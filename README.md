# 🪪 Secure_KYC
## 📝 Problem Statement & Context
About 65–70% Indians are residents of rural and semi-urban areas, where Digital literacy is seen to be low, internet connectivity is poor and the specifications of smart phone are relatively plain.
### 🚧Significant Difficulties:
- KYC processes are slow and error-prone in digital with low-end devices and poor internet.
- Novice users don’t understand sellers’ complex KYC process.
- Difficulties filing documents and concerns about data security.
- Offilne support and retry mechanisms are must due to connectivity black-holes.
Task is to Design a Lightweight KYC Mobile App for Bharat targeting rural and semi-urban India, where smartphone specs are low-end, bandwidth is limited, and users may not be digitally literate.
### 📌The app must support:
- Digilocker-based KYC
- Document-based KYC (Aadhaar, PAN, DL, VoterID)
- Face authentication (liveness, facematch checks)
- Integration with other client apps (SDK integration, web-redirection, etc.)
- Offline & retry-friendly mode
### ✅Features & key elements
1. Product Design & UX:
- How will the app work for users with low digital literacy?
- What will the user flow look like (screens, guidance, fail-safes)? Create wireframes.
- What offline/low-network support will you offer?
2. Features:
- Suggest and implement 2-3 innovative features to improve trust or ease of use using LLMs.
- How will you prioritise which features to build? Create a Prioritisation Matrix
3. Technical Architecture:
- How will you optimize SDK size?
- What trade-offs will you make between on-device vs server-side processing (e.g., facematch, liveness)?
- How will you handle low bandwidth and retry/resume flows?
4. Miscellaneous:
- How would you measure the success of the app?
- Any security concerns and how you’ll solve them?
